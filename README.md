mohanad: Stopped at 7:39 on part 1 of the video. 
i have changed the code for it, like variable names and stuff
note: some implementaion has been updated in unity for example 
in the video it he uses [Serializable] for private field however 
that has been chnanged in the new unity version. now it is [System.Serializable]
so just be carefull.
